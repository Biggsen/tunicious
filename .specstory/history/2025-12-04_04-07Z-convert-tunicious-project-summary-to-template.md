- # AudioFoodie Project Summary
- 
- ## Overview
- 
- **AudioFoodie** is a music backlog management system that transforms music discovery into a structured, manageable listening pipeline. Built on a 10+ year proven methodology, it uses a pipeline-based approach where albums move through rating categories (Queued → Curious → Interested → Great → Excellent → Wonderful) based on listening decisions.
- 
- ### Core Philosophy
- - **Containment**: Limits the number of active albums being evaluated (preventing decision paralysis)
- - **Active Listening**: Requires deliberate decisions to move albums forward
- - **Pipeline Flow**: Albums move through structured stages based on listening decisions
- - **100-Track Limit**: Transient playlists capped at 100 tracks to force decision-making
- 
- ### Current State
- - ✅ 10+ years of proven methodology in personal use
- - ✅ Single user system (personal use)
- - ✅ Spotify integration with Last.fm for listening data
- - ✅ Manual playlist management
- - ✅ Vue 3 frontend with Firebase backend
- 
- ## Tech Stack
- 
- - **Frontend**: Vue 3 (Composition API), Vite, TailwindCSS
- - **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Functions)
- - **APIs**: Spotify API, Last.fm API
- - **Development**: Storybook for component development
- - **Styling**: SCSS + TailwindCSS
- 
- ## Key Features
- 
- 1. **Pipeline Playlist System**: Source → Transient → Terminal → Sink roles
- 2. **Album Tracking**: Tracks album progression through playlists
- 3. **Last.fm Integration**: Loved tracks and playcounts
- 4. **Spotify Player Integration**: In-app playback
- 5. **Album Mappings**: Handles alternate Spotify album IDs
- 6. **Caching System**: localStorage-based track data caching
-

- 
- # Outstanding Tasks
- 
- ## Critical/High Priority Tasks
- 
- ### 1. Firebase Project Separation
- **Status**: Not Started  
- **Spec**: &#96;tasks/firebase-project-separation-spec.md&#96;
-

- **Key Tasks:**
- - Create &#96;pipelineGroups&#96; collection
- - Implement graph-based group inference algorithm
- - Migrate existing playlists to new structure
- - Update UI to use new group system
- - Remove legacy &#96;group&#96; field

+   END OF TEMPLATE
+   
+   This template demonstrates the structure expected by Project Atlas.
+   
+   Key points:
+   1. Manifest block MUST be at the top with valid JSON
+   2. Four work item types are defined: Features, Enhancements, Bugs, Tasks
+   3. Items are tagged by the section they appear in (no inference needed)
+   4. TODO items use - [ ] (incomplete) and - [x] (completed) format
+   5. Follow this structure when creating or regenerating project files
+   
+   Work Item Types:
+   - Features: New functionality (sections like "Features (Done)", "Features (In Progress)")
+   - Enhancements: Improvements to existing features (section: "Enhancements")
+   - Bugs: Problems to fix (sections like "Known Issues", "Active Bugs")
+   - Tasks: Inbox for uncategorized work (section: "Outstanding Tasks")
+   
+   The parser will:
+   - Extract the manifest block and validate it
+   - Parse markdown sections and extract work items
+   - Tag items with their type based on section headings
+   - Identify TODO items (- [ ] and - [x]) across all sections
+   - Preserve markdown structure (lists, paragraphs, etc.)
+ --&gt;

Converted the project summary to the template format. Changes:

1. **Added manifest block** at the top with project metadata (projectId, name, domain, type, tags, etc.)

2. **Restructured sections** to match the template:
   - **Project Overview** — includes Core Philosophy and Key Features
   - **Tech Stack** — unchanged
   - **Current Focus** — highlights the Unified Track Data Cache work
   - **Features (Done)** — completed features and completed tasks
   - **Features (In Progress)** — Unified Track Data Cache with details
   - **Enhancements** — enhancement tasks organized by priority
   - **Outstanding Tasks** — Firebase Project Separation and Pipeline Groups Refactoring
   - **Project Status** — metrics and current state
   - **Next Steps** — reorganized into immediate, short-term, and long-term (including commercialization phases)
   - **Notes** — preserved original notes

3. **Used proper TODO format** — converted items to `- [ ]` and `- [x]` format

4. **Preserved all original content** — reorganized to match the template structure

The file is now in the template format and ready for use with Project Atlas.
