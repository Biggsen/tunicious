# Conditional Pagination in Vue Component (2025-03-29 23:26Z)

_**User (2025-03-29 23:26Z)**_

don't show pagination if there is no pagination required

I'll help you modify the `PlaylistSingle.vue` file to hide the pagination controls when they're not needed. This would be when there are fewer albums than the items per page.

Let me first explain the change I'll make:
1. We'll add a computed property to check if pagination is needed
2. We'll use this property to conditionally render the pagination controls

Here's how I'll make this change:

I've made the following changes:
1. Added a new computed property `showPagination` that returns `true` only when there are more albums than the items per page
2. Added a `v-if="showPagination"` directive to the pagination controls div, which will hide the entire pagination section when it's not needed

Now the pagination controls will only appear when there are more albums than can fit on a single page (more than 20 albums in this case). When there are 20 or fewer albums, the pagination controls will be hidden entirely.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?
