<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is asking about reducing the line height for an artist name that appears to be too large. Looking at the image they've provided, it shows what appears to be a Last.fm album or music widget with an artist name that has excessive line height spacing.

I need to find where this artist name styling is being applied in the codebase. Let me search for artist name related components and styling.

I should search for:
1. Artist name components
2. CSS/styling related to artist names
3. Any line-height properties that might be affecting this

Let me start by searching for artist-related components and styling.</details></think>

I can see the line height issue in the image. Let me search for the artist name styling in your codebase to identify where this is being applied.

Looking at the codebase, I can see the issue is likely in the `AlbumItem.vue` component where the artist name is displayed. Let me examine the styling more closely:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">
<details><summary>Tool use: **read_file** • Read file: src/components/AlbumItem.vue</summary>

I can see the issue! The `.album-artist` class doesn't have any line-height styling applied, so it's likely inheriting the default line-height. Looking at the image, it appears the artist name has too much vertical spacing. Let me fix this by adding a `leading-tight` class to reduce the line-height:

---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file** • Edit file: src/components/AlbumItem.vue</summary>

I'm adding leading-tight to the album-artist class to reduce the line height for better visual appearance.

Perfect! I've reduced the line height for the artist name by adding `leading-tight` to the `.album-artist` class. This should reduce the excessive vertical spacing you were seeing in the artist name display. The `leading-tight` class applies a line-height of 1.25, which is tighter than the default line-height and should give you a much cleaner appearance.

_**User (2025-06-20 17:50Z)**_

no, still looks the same. use the same line height as the album title as that looks fine

Let me look at the album title styling to see what line-height it uses, and then apply the same to the artist name.

Looking at the previous code, I can see that the album title has this styling:
```css
.album-name {
  @apply font-bold leading-tight mb-1 text-delft-blue;
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

So the album title already uses `leading-tight`. But the user is saying the artist name still looks the same and wants to use the same line height as the album title. Let me check if there's something else affecting the line height, or if I need to be more specific about the styling.

Actually, let me look more carefully at the album title styling. It has `leading-tight` which should be line-height: 1.25. But maybe I need to also look at any other styling that might be affecting this.

Let me check if the change actually took effect properly, and also look at what specific styling the album title has that makes it look good.</details></think>

You're right, let me check what exact styling the album title uses and apply the same to the artist name.

<tool-use data-tool-type="read" data-tool-name="read_file">

I can see that both the album name and album artist already have `leading-tight` applied. The album name also has the webkit line-clamp properties. Let me apply the exact same styling from the album-name to the album-artist:

Now the artist name should have the exact same line-height behavior as the album title, using the webkit line-clamp properties that help control the vertical spacing. This should give you the same clean, tight appearance that the album title has.
