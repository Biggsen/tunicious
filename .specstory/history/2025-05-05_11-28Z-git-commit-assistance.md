_**User (2025-05-10 09:21Z)**_

are you able to commit to git?

I don't have the ability to directly commit changes to your git repository. However, I can propose git commands for you to run, such as staging files, committing with a message, or pushing to a remote. If you need help with any git operations, just let me know what you want to do, and I can suggest the exact commands for you to execute.
