# Logging Album Data in Vue Component (2025-03-31 20:55Z)

I'll help you add logging to see the album data. I'll add a console.log statement to show the album data after it's loaded.

Let me edit the `PlaylistSingle.vue` file to add logging:


---

<tool-use data-tool-type="write" data-tool-name="edit_file">

<details><summary>Tool use: **edit_file** • Edit file: src/views/PlaylistSingle.vue</summary>

**Chunk 1**

      }]
    }));
+ 
+   console.log('Album Data:', albumData.value);
  
    await setCache(cacheKey.value, {
```

</details>

</tool-use>

I've added a console.log statement that will show all the album data after it's loaded. This will display:
- Album IDs
- Album names
- Release dates
- Image URLs
- Artist information

You can now:
1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Load any playlist page
4. You'll see the complete album data logged in the console

This will help you verify the album IDs and other data that's being loaded. Let me know if you'd like to see any additional information or if you need the data formatted differently!
