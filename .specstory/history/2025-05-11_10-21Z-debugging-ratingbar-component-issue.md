# Debugging RatingBar Component Issue (2025-05-11 10:21Z)

_**User (2025-05-11 07:24Z)**_

hmm, the ratingBar is not longer showing. can we console log out some of that data?

To debug why the `RatingBar` is not showing, you should log the props and computed values inside the `RatingBar.vue` component. This will help you verify if the component is receiving the expected `priority` and `category` values, and if the computed values are as expected.

Here’s what you should log:
- The incoming `props`
- The computed `rating`
- The computed `bgClass`
- The computed bar width

I will add `console.log` statements for these inside the `<script setup>` block of `RatingBar.vue`.

Console log statements have been added to `RatingBar.vue` to output the props, computed rating, background class, and bar width. Reload your app and check the browser console for these logs to help diagnose why the `RatingBar` is not showing. If you need to log more or want to check the parent data, let me know.
