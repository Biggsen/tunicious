The service-account.json file was not previously listed in .gitignore. I have now added it to ensure it is not tracked by git.

It is strongly recommended to git ignore service-account.json because it typically contains sensitive credentials (such as private keys and service account details) for accessing Firebase or Google Cloud services. Committing this file to your repository can expose your project to security risks, especially if the repository is public or shared.

**Best practices:**
- Keep service-account.json out of version control (.gitignore).
- Store it securely and share it only with trusted team members.
- Use environment variables or secret management tools for CI/CD and deployment.

In summary:  
You do not have to git ignore service-account.json for your project to function, but you absolutely should to protect sensitive information and follow security best practices.
