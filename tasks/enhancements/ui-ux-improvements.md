# UI/UX Improvements

## **Status**: Ongoing Collection

This document contains small UI/UX tweaks and improvements for polish and better user experience. These are lightweight changes that don't require full specifications.

## UI Tweaks

### Visual Polish
- [ ] The style showing what playlist is being played needs to be improved, more visible

### Component Styling
- [ ] Playlist item should show albums count

### Layout & Spacing
- [ ] _Add items here_

---

## UX Improvements

### User Feedback
- [ ] Would be nice to have a visual indicator as to what album is playing on the album item (on PlaylistSingle view)
- [ ] Highlight the next playlist to listen to - provide visual indication of which playlist should be listened to next in the pipeline workflow

### Navigation & Flow
- [ ] You should be able to play a playlist straight from the Playlists page
- [ ] Check if we still need the refresh button on the PlaylistSingle page

### Accessibility
- [ ] _Add items here_

### Performance Perception
- [ ] Add reload button for each playlist group on the tab - currently only have a global reload button that loads every single playlist again, which is inefficient. Per-group reload would limit the amount of playlists reloaded.

### Data Management
- [ ] Ability to remove/clean out a playlist history record
