# Add Album to Playlist Page Specification

## **Status**: ✅ Complete & Tested

**Last Verified**: User testing confirmed all functionality working correctly

## Overview

This document specifies the creation of a dedicated "Add Album to Playlist" page, moving the functionality from embedded panels in `PlaylistManagementView.vue` and `PlaylistSingle.vue` to a standalone page similar to the playlist management page structure.

## Goals

1. **Dedicated Interface**: Create a focused page for adding albums to playlists
2. **Improved UX**: Separate the add album functionality from playlist management and individual playlist views
3. **Flexible Navigation**: Support both standalone use and navigation from specific playlist pages
4. **Consistency**: Follow the same design patterns as `PlaylistManagementView.vue`

## Current State

### Existing Implementation

The "Add Album to Playlist" functionality currently exists in two locations:

1. **PlaylistManagementView.vue** (lines 72-108)
   - Includes playlist selector dropdown
   - Allows adding albums to any playlist
   - Located at `/playlist/management`

2. **PlaylistSingle.vue** (lines 3020-3039)
   - Adds album to the current playlist (no selector)
   - Uses playlist ID from route params
   - Located at `/playlist/:id`

### Issues with Current Implementation

- Duplicated functionality across two components
- Inconsistent UX (selector in one, no selector in the other)
- Clutters playlist management and single playlist views
- No dedicated space for this common operation

## Proposed Solution

### New Page: Add Album to Playlist

**Route**: `/playlist/add-album`  
**Component**: `AddAlbumToPlaylistView.vue`  
**Location**: `src/views/playlists/AddAlbumToPlaylistView.vue`

#### Features

- Album search using `AlbumSearch` component
- Playlist selector dropdown (shows Tunicious playlists by default)
- Pre-select playlist when navigating from a playlist page (via query string)
- Add album to both Spotify playlist and Firebase collection
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- Cache clearing after successful addition
- Back button to return to playlists page

#### Query String Support

- **Parameter**: `playlistId`
- **Usage**: When navigating from a playlist page, pre-select that playlist
- **Example**: `/playlist/add-album?playlistId=abc123`
- **Behavior**: If `playlistId` is provided, automatically select it in the dropdown (if valid and found in filtered playlists)
- **Invalid Handling**: If `playlistId` doesn't match any playlist in the dropdown, silently ignore it and show empty selection

## Page Specifications

```

### Form Fields

#### Album Search
- **Component**: `AlbumSearch` (existing component - includes built-in "Search albums" label)
- **Binding**: `v-model="selectedAlbum"`
- **Validation**: Required before submission
- **Placement**: Left column in grid layout

#### Target Playlist
- **Type**: Select dropdown
- **Binding**: `v-model="albumForm.playlistId"`
- **Options**: User's Tunicious playlists (filtered using `isTuniciousPlaylist()`)
- **Format**: `{playlist.name} ({playlist.tracks.total} tracks)`
- **Default**: Pre-selected if `playlistId` query param exists and matches a playlist in the filtered list
- **Validation**: Required before submission
- **Placement**: Right column in grid layout

### User Flow

#### Standalone Use
1. User navigates to `/playlist/add-album`
2. Page loads and fetches user's playlists
3. User searches for and selects an album
4. User selects target playlist from dropdown
5. User clicks "Add Album to Playlist"
6. Album is added to Spotify playlist
7. Album is added to Firebase collection
8. Success toast notification displayed
9. Form resets (album search cleared, playlist selection cleared unless from query param)
10. Cache cleared to update track counts

#### From Playlist Page
1. User is viewing a playlist at `/playlist/:id`
2. User clicks link/button to add album
3. Navigates to `/playlist/add-album?playlistId=:id`
4. Page loads with playlist pre-selected
5. User searches for and selects an album
6. User clicks "Add Album to Playlist" (playlist already selected)
7. Album is added to Spotify playlist
8. Album is added to Firebase collection
9. Success toast notification displayed
10. Form resets (album search cleared, playlist remains selected since it came from query param)

## Technical Implementation

### New Component

**File**: `src/views/playlists/AddAlbumToPlaylistView.vue`

#### Imports Required
- `useRoute`, `useRouter` from `vue-router`
- `ref`, `onMounted`, `watch` from `vue`
- `useUserData` composable
- `useUserSpotifyApi` composable (including `addAlbumToPlaylist`, `getUserPlaylists`, `isTuniciousPlaylist`, `getPlaylistAlbumsWithDates`)
- `useAlbumsData` composable (including `addAlbumToCollection`)
- `useToast` composable
- `useCurrentUser` from `vuefire`
- `BackButton` component
- `BaseButton` component
- `AlbumSearch` component
- `clearCache` from `@utils/cache`
- `formatAlbumName` from `@utils/formatting`
- `logPlaylist` from `@utils/logger`

#### State Management

```javascript
const route = useRoute();
const selectedAlbum = ref(null);
const albumForm = ref({
  playlistId: route.query.playlistId || '' // Pre-select from query (read only on mount)
});
const userPlaylists = ref([]);
const addingAlbum = ref(false);
const { showToast } = useToast();
```

#### Key Functions

1. **`handleAddAlbum()`**
   - Sets `addingAlbum.value = true`
   - Validates album and playlist selection (shows toast warning if missing)
   - Checks if album already exists in playlist using `getPlaylistAlbumsWithDates()` (shows warning toast if duplicate)
   - Calls `addAlbumToPlaylist()` from `useUserSpotifyApi`
   - Calls `addAlbumToCollection()` from `useAlbumsData` (passes `playlistData: null` to let it fetch internally)
   - Clears cache: `playlist_summaries_${user.uid}` and playlist-specific album cache
   - Dispatches `playlist-albums-updated` event to notify PlaylistSingle if mounted
   - Shows success toast with formatted album name using `formatAlbumName()`
   - Resets form: clears `selectedAlbum` and album search field, keeps `playlistId` if it came from query param
   - Sets `addingAlbum.value = false`
   - On error: shows error toast and logs error

2. **`loadUserPlaylists()`**
   - Fetches user playlists via `getUserPlaylists()`
   - Filters to Tunicious playlists only using `isTuniciousPlaylist()`
   - Populates dropdown
   - If query param `playlistId` exists, attempts to pre-select it (silently ignores if not found)

#### Lifecycle

- `onMounted`: 
  - Read `playlistId` from `route.query.playlistId` (only on initial mount, no watching)
  - Load playlists if Spotify connected
  - Pre-select playlist if query param provided and playlist found in filtered list
- `watch`: Watch for Spotify connection changes to reload playlists when connected

### Router Updates

**File**: `src/router/index.js`

Add new route:

```javascript
{
  path: '/playlist/add-album',
  name: 'addAlbumToPlaylist',
  component: () => import('@views/playlists/AddAlbumToPlaylistView.vue'),
  meta: { 
    requiresAuth: true,
    requiresSpotify: true 
  }
}
```

### Component Updates

#### PlaylistManagementView.vue

**Action**: Remove the "Add Album to Playlist" section (lines 72-108)

**Rationale**: Functionality moved to dedicated page

#### PlaylistSingle.vue

**Action**: Replace the "Add Album to Playlist" section (lines 3020-3039) with a navigation link

**New Code**:
```vue
<div v-if="userData?.spotifyConnected" class="mt-8 bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-6">
  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Add Album to Playlist</h2>
  <router-link 
    :to="{ name: 'addAlbumToPlaylist', query: { playlistId: id } }"
    class="btn-primary inline-block"
  >
    Go to Add Album Page
  </router-link>
</div>
```

**Alternative**: Could also show a button that navigates to the page

### Navigation Updates

#### PlaylistView.vue (Optional)

Add link to dropdown menu for easy access:

```vue
<RouterLink
  to="/playlist/add-album"
  class="block px-4 py-2 text-sm text-delft-blue hover:bg-delft-blue hover:text-white transition-colors no-underline"
  role="menuitem"
>
  <div class="flex items-center gap-2">
    <PlusIcon class="h-4 w-4" />
    <span>Add Album to Playlist</span>
  </div>
</RouterLink>
```

## UI/UX Requirements

### Styling
- Follow existing design patterns from `PlaylistManagementView.vue`
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes
- Match color scheme (delft-blue, mindero, etc.)
- Responsive grid layout (1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop)

### Components
- Use existing `BackButton` component
- Use existing `BaseButton` component
- Use existing `ErrorMessage` component
- Use existing `AlbumSearch` component
- Consistent form styling with `.form-group`, `.form-input` classes

### User Feedback
- Loading states during API calls (using `addingAlbum` ref)
- Toast notifications for success (with formatted album name)
- Toast notifications for errors
- Disabled button states when form invalid (`addingAlbum || !selectedAlbum || !albumForm.playlistId`)
- Clear validation messages via toast

### Accessibility
- Proper form labels
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Album not selected: Toast warning "Please select an album first"
- Playlist not selected: Toast warning "Please select a playlist"
- Album already in playlist: Toast warning with formatted album name "is already in this playlist"
- Both album and playlist required before submission

### API Errors
- Spotify API errors: Toast error with error message
- Firebase errors: Toast error with error message from collection operation
- Network errors: Toast error with generic network error message
- All errors logged via `logPlaylist()`

### Edge Cases
- No playlists available: Show message "No Tunicious playlists found. Create a playlist first."
- Invalid playlistId in query: Silently ignore and show empty selection (no error message)
- Spotify not connected: Show connection warning (not form)

## Cache Management

After successful album addition:
1. Clear playlist summaries cache: `playlist_summaries_${user.uid}` using `clearCache()` utility
2. Clear playlist-specific album cache: `playlist_${playlistId}_albumsWithDates` to ensure PlaylistSingle refreshes
3. Dispatch `playlist-albums-updated` custom event with `playlistId` detail to notify PlaylistSingle if currently mounted
4. No local track count update needed (new page doesn't display playlists)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Create New Page
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

**Tasks**:
1. Create reusable `formatAlbumName()` function in `src/utils/formatting.js`
2. Create `isTuniciousPlaylist()` function in `useUserSpotifyApi` composable (if not already created)
3. Create `AddAlbumToPlaylistView.vue` component
4. Implement form with album search and playlist selector
5. Add query string support for pre-selecting playlist (read only on mount)
6. Implement `handleAddAlbum()` function with toast notifications
7. Add route to router
8. Test standalone page functionality

### Phase 2: Remove from Existing Pages
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

**Tasks**:
1. Remove "Add Album to Playlist" section from `PlaylistManagementView.vue`
2. Replace section in `PlaylistSingle.vue` with navigation link
3. Test navigation from playlist page
4. Verify query parameter passing

### Phase 3: Add Navigation Links (Optional)
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

**Tasks**:
1. Add link to PlaylistView dropdown menu
2. Test navigation from playlists page
3. Verify all navigation paths work

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Keep existing panels in `PlaylistManagementView.vue` and `PlaylistSingle.vue`
2. New page can be disabled via route guard if needed
3. No database changes, so rollback is straightforward
4. Test each phase independently

## Notes

- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Uses existing composables and components
- No new database collections required
- Maintains consistency with `PlaylistSingle.vue` patterns (toast notifications, local loading state)
- Query string approach provides flexibility for future enhancements
- Could add "Recent Playlists" or "Favorite Playlists" in future
- `formatAlbumName()` utility can be reused across the application
- Uses Tunicious terminology (not AudioFoodie) to match current branding
